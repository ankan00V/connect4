**Developing a Connect Four Game in C++**! 

🎮✨I’m thrilled to share the process and insights from this project. Here’s a brief overview of the key steps involved in creating this classic game:

 🧩 1. Board Initialization
I started by setting up a 6x7 grid to represent the Connect Four game board. Each cell was initialized to be empty, ready for the players to make their moves.
```
std::vector<std::vector<char> > board(ROWS, std::vector<char>(COLS, ' '));
```

🎨 2. Print the Board
Next, I created a function to display the current state of the game board. This function includes visual representations of the grid and column indices for a user-friendly interface.
```
void printBoard(const std::vector<std::vector<char> > &board) { /*...*/ }
```

✅ 3. Check for Valid Moves
To ensure players can only place their discs in available columns, I implemented a function that checks if a move is valid.
```cpp
bool isValidMove(const std::vector<std::vector<char> > &board, int col) { /*...*/ }
```

🎯 4. Make a Move
This function handles placing a disc in the correct position based on the player’s choice and the validity of the move.
```
bool makeMove(std::vector<std::vector<char> > &board, int col, char player) { /*...*/ }
```

🏆 5. Check for a Win
To determine if a player has won, I developed a function that checks all possible win conditions: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal.
```
bool checkWin(const std::vector<std::vector<char> > &board, char player) { /*...*/ }
```

🔄 6. Main Game Loop
The core of the game is the loop that alternates between players, processes moves, and checks for a winner or a draw.
```cpp
int main() { /*...*/ }
```
